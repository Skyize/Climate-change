            <p>
<h3>1. What is Climate Change?</h3>

<b>Definition: Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the average temperature, weather patterns, and other climate parameters on Earth.</b><hr/>
<h3>2. Causes of Climate Change:</h3>

<b>Human Activities: The primary driver of recent climate change is human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes.<br/>
Greenhouse Gases: These activities release greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and others.<br/>
Enhanced Greenhouse Effect: Increased concentrations of GHGs trap more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a warming effect known as the enhanced greenhouse effect.<br/></b><hr/>
<h3>3. Impact on Global Temperatures:</h3>

<b>Global Warming: The Earth's average surface temperature has been rising, contributing to global warming.<br/>
Temperature Extremes: Climate change is associated with more frequent and intense heatwaves, as well as shifts in temperature patterns.<br/></b><hr/>
<h3>4. Effects on Weather Patterns:</h3>

<b>Extreme Weather Events: Changes in climate lead to more severe and frequent extreme weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires.<br/></b><hr/>
<h3>5. Impact on Oceans:</h3>

<b>Rising Sea Levels: Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, posing a threat to coastal areas and low-lying regions.<br/>
Ocean Acidification: Increased absorption of CO2 by the oceans leads to ocean acidification, affecting marine ecosystems.<br/></b><hr/>
<h3>6. Changes in Ecosystems:</h3>

<b>Shifts in Habitats: Climate change can alter ecosystems and force species to migrate or adapt to new conditions.<br/>
Loss of Biodiversity: Some species may struggle to survive in changing climates, leading to a loss of biodiversity.<br/></b><hr/></p>
